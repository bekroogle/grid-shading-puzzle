          This is the grid shading puzzle that was printed on Christmas cards sent out for the 2015 season by Britain's intelligence agency, GCHQ.

          I've created this site as a way to play the puzzle without pen and paper.

          Version specific instructions:
        %ul
          %li
            Tap a grid cell to toggle its shading.
          %li
            Use a long-tap to toggle a cell's lock. This allows you to lock in cells that you're certain about, so that you don't accidentally change them.
