        <p>
          This is the grid shading puzzle that was printed on Christmas cards sent out for the 2015 season by Britain's intelligence agency, GCHQ.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've created this site as a way to play the puzzle without pen and paper.

          Version specific instructions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Tap a grid cell to toggle its shading.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use a long-tap to toggle a cell's lock. This allows you to lock in cells that you're certain about, so that you don't accidentally change them.
          </li>
          <li>
            When you've met the requirements for a row or column, the label will turn green. When all rows and columns are green, you've won!
          </li>
